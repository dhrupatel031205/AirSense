## ðŸš€ Current Authentication System

The system now uses **Django's built-in authentication only**:

- **Login**: `/users/login/` - Simple username/password form
- **Register**: `/users/register/` - Standard Django user creation
- **Logout**: `/users/logout/` - Django logout view

## ðŸ“‹ Demo Account

- **Username**: demo
- **Password**: demo123

## âœ… What Still Works

- User registration and login
- Session-based authentication
- User profiles and preferences
- Dashboard access control
- All existing features

## ðŸ”§ Clean System

The authentication system is now simplified to use only Django's built-in features:
- No third-party OAuth providers
- No external dependencies for auth
- Simple, reliable username/password authentication
- All social login references removed

The system is now completely self-contained for authentication!
